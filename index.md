## About Me

I am a BSc student at Beihang Univerisity, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am currently working with Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at [Mila - Qu√©bec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/). During my undergraduate years at BUAA, I was supervised by  Prof. [Si Liu](http://colalab.net/) and I was fortunate to work with Dr. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/) at Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence. I was also a research intern at Alibaba Inc., where I worked on dance generation with Dr. [Aixi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=hNTP47EAAAAJ&hl=en).
